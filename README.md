# Recitation 1 - Variables, input, and casting

## Learning Objective:

1. Develop experience with Java input and output functionality.
2. Use type casting to force type conversion without producing a compiler error.
3. Use different primitive types in Java.

## Required Activity

Implement the tasks below in the **BasicInpupt.java**
file provided with this IntelliJ project.

1. Prompt the user to input an integer, a double, a character, and a string, storing each into separate variables. Then, output those four values on a single line separated by a space.

```
Enter integer:
99
Enter double:
3.77
Enter character:
z
Enter string:
Howdy
99 3.77 z Howdy
```

2. Extend to also output in reverse.

```
Enter integer:
99
Enter double:
3.77
Enter character:
z
Enter string:
Howdy
99 3.77 z Howdy
Howdy z 3.77 99
```

3. Extend to cast the double to an integer, and output that integer.
```
Enter integer:
99
Enter double:
3.77
Enter character:
z
Enter string:
Howdy
99 3.77 z Howdy
Howdy z 3.77 99
3.77 cast to an integer is 3
```
